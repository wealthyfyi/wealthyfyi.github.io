		title: "A healthy future ahead of you",
		brief: "Healthcare is expensive, and it only gets more expensive as you get older. Fortunately you're preparing for it by fully funding your Health Savings Account (HSA). Did you know an HSA is the best retirement account in America? There are no taxes on the income that funds it, the gains in the HSA, nor on the withdrawals for eligible health expenses. If you can avoid withdrawing for your expenses now, it'll pay of dramatically over time."

		title: "Build an emergency fund",
		brief: "Being prepared for emergencies is the first step towards financial freedom. Get started by saving enough cash to cover a month of expenses in a high yield savings account."
	},
	employermatch1 : {
		title: "Get unbeatable returns",
		brief: "When your employer matches your contributions to a 401(K) account, it's like you're getting an guaranteed 100% return on your investment. Adjusted for risk, it's probably the best investment you can make. As an added bonus, your contribution and the employer match are tax advantaged."
	},
	highinterest1 : {
		title: "Pay down high interest loans",
		brief: "Loans that have an interest rate similar to or higher than your investment return rate should be paid off before investing. Since investment has some risk of producing lower returns and loan interest is fixed, it's usually good to pay off loans with >5% interest before investing."
	},
	hsafees1 : {
		title: "Give your HSA a health check",
		brief: "While the Health Savings Account (HSA) is the best investment account in America, not all of them are created equal. Some have higher management fees than others. It's worth checking to see if you could be paying lower fees by switching to another HSA provider."
	},
	hsamax1 : {
		title: "Invest in your future health",
		brief: "The Health Savings Account (HSA) is the best investing account America. Once you've maxed out your employer matching in your 401(K) account, the next best thing to max out is your HSA. It provides all the tax advantages of both a Traditional and a Roth retirement account, making it a better way to invest than both of them."
	},
	evaluateiratype : {
		title: "Traditional or Roth IRA?",
		brief: "Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) provide tax incentives to encourage you to save for your future. Contributions to a Traditional account reduce your tax bill now, reducing the burden on your budget today. Money you contribute to a Roth account is taxed normally, but all the growth is tax-free. Generally it's better to use a Roth account if you expect your income to go up, otherwise a Traditional account is likely better."
	},
	maxira : {
		title: "Max out that IRA",
		brief: "An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) provide tax incentives to encourage you to save for your future. These tax incentives help your dollars do more for you by reducing how many of them you have to give to the government. Contributing the full limit to your IRA helps your money do more for you."
	},
	maxtraditionalira : {
		title: "Max out a Traditional IRA",
		brief: "An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) provide tax incentives to encourage you to save for your future. Using a Traditional IRA will reduce your tax bill today, making it easier to invest. Those savings will be able to grow unimpeded; you won't have to pay taxes until you withdraw your money in retirement."
	},
	evaluateespp : {
		title: "Grow with your employer",
		brief: "Some companies have an Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) that allows employees to use a portion of their salary to purchase shares of the company at a discounted price. There are typically no restrictions on when you can sell the shares either. If your employer offers an ESPP with these characteristics, it's likely you can increase your income by contributing the maximum amount to the ESPP and then selling the shares immediately when you get them to avoid becoming over-exposed to your employer."
	},
	othergoalsavings : {
		title: "Prepare for expected expenses",
		brief: "Whether it's a car, house, college, elder care, or other major upcoming expense you expect to have in the next 5 years, you should start saving now if you haven't. For planned expenses within the next 5 years, it's usually better put your savings in something with a lower risk than stocks. A high yield savings account and bonds are great places to park money with a very low risk tolerance."
	},
	max401k : {
		title: "Max your 401(K)",
		brief: "The tax advantage from investing in a 401(K) account is a major accelerator for retirement savings. Contributing the maximum amount of money allowed by the IRS is a great way to get the most out of your money."
	},
	megabackdoor : {
		title: "The \"Mega Backdoor\"",
		brief: "If you've maxed your 401(K) and are looking to invest even more money, the \"Mega backdoor\" Roth IRA might be what you're looking for. It's only available with some employers - you'll need to be able to make after-tax 401(K) contributions and roll them over to a Roth IRA. If your retirement plan offers that, you can contribute up to $58k in 2021 to your 401(K), which includes the $19.5k contribution limit and your employer match. Anything left in the $58k limit can be contributed using the \"Mega backdoor\" method for even more tax-advantaged savings."
	},
	esa : {
		title: "Saving for education",
		brief: "If you want to pay for college, trade school, private K-12 school, apprenticeships, or student loans, whether for yourself or someone else, you should consider using a 529 plan Education Savings Account (ESA). Growth in an ESA isn't taxed if it's withdrawn for eligible education expenses. This makes it a great way to save for future education expenses."
	},
	mortgagepayments : {
		title: "Consider paying off your mortgage",
		brief: "Mortgages are one of the lowest cost loans available. For most people with over a decade of working years ahead of them, there are higher expected returns investing in the stock market. It might be worth paying off your mortgage faster instead if you are close to retirement, have low risk tolerance, or think that the peace of mind knowing that your home is paid off is more valuable than potentially higher returns of investing in the stock market."
	},
	taxablebrokerage : {
		title: "Invest in a regular brokerage account",
		brief: "If you've got more money left over after maxing all the tax-advantaged accounts that are available to you and relevant to your investing goals, it might make sense to use a regular brokerage account. The only limit to how much you can invest in a regular brokerage account is the amount of money you have available to invest. Once the other options are maxed, this is the go-to option."
	},
	taxharvesting : {
		title: "Flex your inner farmer",
		brief: "Short-term losses provide the biggest benefit because they offset short-term gains, which are taxed at a higher marginal rate. Conversely, short-term losses are least effective when used to offset long-term gains. Note that whether the loss is short- or long-term, it must be used to offset a gain of the same time first before it can be applied to the other. Even if you didn't realize any gains this year, it can still be effective to realize your losses because a portion may be used to offset some ordinary income, and the remaining can be carried forward to future years."
	},
	lowinterestdebts : {
		title: "Debt is heavy on the mind",
		brief: "\"Low-interest\" debt is typically considered as debt that is below the average rate-of-return for the stock market over time, which is about 7% adjusted for inflation. Many people have low-interest debts designed to be repaid over a long time in the form of mortgages or student loans. By definition, it's better to invest your money than pay off low-interest debt agressively, however there can be an emotional toll to debt. Evaluate if it is worthwhile to allocate <em>some, but not all</em> of your excess cash to paying off your low-interest debt early."
	},
	donoradvisedfunds : {
		title: "Efficient charity with donor-advised funds",
		brief: "You don't have to be wealthy to open a donor-advised fund. Donor-advised funds are assets set aside for donation over time which are managed by a sponsoring organization. Assets include: cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, IRAs, 401Ks, private company stock, cryptocurrency, and life insurance. DAFs are an efficient donation vehicle because they avoid capital gains tax on stocks, bonds and mutual funds by donating the asset itself, rather than selling the asset and donating the proceeds, post-tax. To get the most out of them, donate assets that have grown substantially - the current value of the assets is tax deductible and you avoid paying taxes on the growth."
	},
	rebalanceportfolio : {
		title: "It's a juggling act",
		brief: "Your asset risk should reflect your risk tolerance. Over time, investments will grow and shrink. Rebalancing your portfolio nudges it back to the initial asset ratios through buying and selling. Rebalancing strategies include ongoing maintenance, focusing on rebalancing your largest account, and treating each account as a separate fully-balanced portfolio. You may choose to rebalance in April (tax-season), December (tax-loss harvesting season), when an investment shifts >5% or never."
